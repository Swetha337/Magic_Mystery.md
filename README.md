STEPS TO FOLLOW: <br/>
•	To find the flag, we need to analyze the hexdump of the file chall.png. <br/>
•	Open a terminal. <br/>
•	Type the command: hexdump -C chall.png | less. This command will display the hexdump of the file in a readable format. <br/>
•	Next, compare the hexdump of chall.png with the hexdump of another valid PNG file. Identify any discrepancies or errors in the hexdump of chall.png. <br/>
•	To correct these mistakes, we use a hexdump editor like GHex <br/>
•	Upload the chall.png file to GHex. <br/>
•	Edit the mistakes identified in the hexdump. <br/>
•	Save the corrected file.<br/>
•	Finally, open the corrected file. It will reveal an image containing the flag. <br/>
